This model combined broad-based liberal arts studies with experiential learning that took students out of the classroom and into the field to observe and apply academic theories in real life. </p>\r\n<p>Norwich&rsquo;s academic programs reflect the highest standards in teaching, curriculum development, and online education delivery. Norwich enlists academic subject matter experts from across the globe to develop courses that are highly informative and immediately applicable to students&rsquo; careers. Norwich faculty members, in turn, bring those courses to life in the Norwich virtual classroom.
